# Project Summary

**Customer:** Senior Management Team

**Project name:** NHS GP Prescription Analytics

**Project goal:** Produce an intelligence report on GP prescription costs to assist the senior management team in their meeting with NHS commissioners.

## Objectives:

The report should contain the following:
- Summary of current costs of prescriptions.
- Analysis of those costs.
- A 6 month trend analysis.
- A summary of the costs by 3 areas: 'Area Team', 'PCO' and 'Practice'.
- A 'live' report that cant be updated when new data is released.

## Constraints:

- Must be completed by Friday 6th November 2020.
- 6 months of data available only.

## Risks:

- There is a risk that large datasets require a lot of cleaning and time for analysis is brief. [**SIGNIFICANT RISK**]
- There is a risk that time restrictions of the project mean only simple analysis can be done, and more advanced insight is not possible. [MODEST RISK]

## Assumptions:

- 6 months of data will be provided. 
- Data will be accurate.
- Data is complete - i.e. no area teams, PCOs or GP practices are excluded.
- Costs are measures in ****
